    <h2>The Idea</h2>

    <p>
      General Motors (GM) is pushing to have apps on the infotainment dashboard.  Just recently,
      GM announced that drivers will be able to order <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/news/general-motors-marketplace-infotainment-system-technology-video-article-1.3683789">food from the infotainment center</a>.  These
      apps on the infotainment dashboard are built with web technologies, and they
      have additional APIs that fetch data from the sensors of the car.  Access to that many APIs
      is fantastic, and I thought what data could I pull and put to good use.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could not get access to those APIs just yet however, because of some weird
      release cycle that was happening with GM cars.  So I let that idea settle for a moment.
      In time, that idea kept on creeping back into my mind, like Gollum tracking down the Fellowship
      in Lord of the Rings. I wanted to do something about it.  I saw that some apps like Waze
      updated to show the speed.  I wondered how Waze could do that even without access to car sensors.
    </p>

    <p>
      I knew that one could access Geolocation API on their phone.  So I thought up some
      bright innovative idea to calculate the speed based off of the distance between two geocoordiante
      points and elapsed time. That is how one normally calculate's speed right?  Distance... over... time...
      yeah right?  That proved to be  more difficult than I thought as it wasn't just simple math.  I
      needed to get more accurate and faster calculations and that method was not cutting the pie as
      it should have been doing.  As I was developing this way of calculating speed with two geocoordinate
      points, I noticed a little detail in the JavaScript Geolocation API.  Geolocation API provided longitude
      and latitude points, but it as well provided altitude, speed, and heading points.
      My innovative idea wasn't so innovative any more, like shooting a rabbit with a bow and arrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, I grabbed the opportunity and used the extra data that I did not know
      existed beforehand.  I made an <a href="https://spedo-34021.firebaseapp.com/">mobile
      interface with Firebase</a>.  I wanted to shoot this idea out quickly, and Firebase
      was just the right tool that could help.  I spun up some Firebase instances, got some
      cutting edge es6 JavaScript implemented, and downloaded some hardcore icons from
      <a href="https://feathericons.com/">FeatherIcons</a>.  Like the good ol' Beatles Song,
      "All together now!"
    </p>

    <p>
      As I was developing this app, more ideas started to pop into my head.  Austin is a
      busy place when it comes to traffic in between the time periods
      of 7-9 AM and 4-7 PM.  I live about 8 miles from where I work, and I was wondering
      if I could gather imperical data showing which route would be better to take
      returning home.  My home-made custom mobile application could help me do this!  I added
      some more administrative detail with the Firebase instance
      I made, like database read/write rules and JSON data structure for collecting data.
    </p>

    <p id="trialRunSection">
      I finished iteration after iteration and I finally got to a working model.  There were
      several features I made with the first working beta model.  Speed is shown on screen in
      meters per second.  Speed tracking can be turned off and on.  Data is only logged if the
      user is logged in with their Google account.  The data upload can be turned off and on.
      Behind the scene with the Firebase instance, only the logged in user can upload data
      under their own UID in the database.  I was set and ready to go for a trial run, like an
      elementary school kid going to his first day of school!
    </p>

    <h2>Trial Run (or ride depending on how you view it) <img id="trendy" src="./icons/trending-up.svg" alt="Trending up icon"></h2>

    <p>
      I finished the first working version on a beautiful Texan Saturday afternoon.  I had
      recently started a small hobby of going trail biking.  My favorite location to go to
      (the only location I have gone to so far) is Walnut Creek Park, smack dab in the middle
      of northern Austin.  I retrieved my bike and gear and I placed them in my car.  I
      went to the driver seat, and put the key in the ignition and turned it to turn on my
      car.  I had previously bought LTE Hotspot service for my car from OnStar, so I connected
      to my WiFi hotspot from my phone.  I opened up Google Chrome, and typed in the URL
      address for my little project.  I kept the phone screen on (because the data does not
      upload if the screen is turned off) and I drove to Walnut Creek Park.  When I arrived at the
      park, I stopped the data tracking and I went off for my bike ride.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finished my bike ride, and I returned home without any data tracking.  I double checked
      my Firebase console and saw that I had over 500 data points uploaded!  I was happy that it
      had something!  Now I just need to get it displayed somehow.  Having a lot of data and not a way
      of displaying it is like trying to perceive if grass blades are all bent the same way in a field.
      So I decided to use <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chartjs</a> to plot out all the data points (chickens) that I had
      gathered.  I had to do some fancy ETL (Extract Transform Load) process in order to use the
      data with Chartjs.  I made the function to gather all the x and y points that I needed.
      The x points are unix timestamps, and the y points pertain to their respective data value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without further long winded introductions to a simple trial run graph...  (drum-roll sounds)
      tadaa!
    </p>

    <div class="chartman">
      <canvas id="trialRunChart"></canvas>
    </div>

    <p>Note, data points only shown of every 5 seconds and any speed of 0 is truncated.</p>

    <p id="gathererSection">
        What do I learn from this graph? Well for one, Walnut Creek Park is about 50 meters
        lower than where I live.  That was interesting to perceive.  Also my speed is just
        a set of parabolic arches (don't know the significance of that).  In it's entirety,
        do I know exactly what this data means as well?  I'm not entirely sure of that.  Does
        data presentation look cool, like when the Golden Arches first
        stood in Southern California? I sure do think it does!
    </p>

    <h2>Gatherer of Data <img id="barChartIcon" src="./icons/bar-chart.svg" alt="Bar Chart Icon"></h2>

    <p id="parmerRiataSection">Now I can gather my data!</p>

    <h3>Parmer Through Riata</h3>

    <div class="chartman">
      <canvas id="ParmerRiata"></canvas>
    </div>

    <!-- <div id="ParmerRiataMap" class="map"></div> -->

    <div class="stat" id="ParmerRiataStats"></div>

    <p>It's not very fun driving home...</p>

    <p>Note for all graphs, you can click where it says "Run 1 (m/s)" (etc), to make certain datasets disappear.</p>

    <p>
      Note, data points only shown of every 5 seconds and any speed of 0 is truncated.
      The colors are also randomly generated so if you have a bad color set then I suggest
      a <label id="refresh">refresh</label>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So this graph was done in the time period of 12 December to 15 December 2017.  The data may be a little
      skewed because it is probable that most of the real traffic just was not there because of the
      holidays.  However, from personal observation the traffic remained just about the same.  The data I gathered
      is me traveling between the hours of 5 - 6 pm.  The third time I started recording data, I did start a little
      bit latter (but still in between 5-6 pm) and I did see a slight decrease in traffic in some areas.
    </p>

    <p>I also observe that my time termination got shorter.</p>

    <h3>Parmer Through Riata Long</h3>

    <div class="chartman">
      <canvas id="ParmerRiataLong"></canvas>
    </div>

    <!-- <div id="ParmerRiataLongMap" class="map"></div> -->

    <div class="stat" id="ParmerRiataLongStats"></div>

    <p>
      Yeah no.  I decided to try this way, in order to avoid the build up of traffic that comes out of
      the Apple offices here.
